Create Read Update and Delete or simply CRUD operation which means user can create data, read the data, update the data or delete the data.
In this project, I created a crud operation for student enrollment system in which user can add new student details like name, email and password. After that, the added student will be shown to the same page with the entered details. If user wants to change the data of student, he/she simply can click on the edit button. If user wants to delete any data of student, he/she can simply click on delete button.
